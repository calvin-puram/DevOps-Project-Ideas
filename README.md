> A curated collection of realistic DevOps project ideas that you can start working on right away to improve your skills. I came up with this projects through real-world scenarios in larger organizations and checking out requirements in job ads

## Introduction

**DevOps Project Ideas** is a curated collection of DevOps project ideas based on real-world scenarios. DevOps teams may already be performing or will be required to accomplish these tasks.

Either you're transitioning into DevOps from a career as a developer or sysadmin, or you're looking to improve your DevOps skills for an entry-level position, you may be feeling exhausted by the huge amount of work ahead of you!. With basic knowledge of DevOps tools you can apply them to deploy software using this guide. These real-world projects are all focused on deploying software.

These projects cannot be completed using web consoles or point-and-click methods. You must use scripting and automation to tackle all of these issues. And besides, DevOps is built on the notion of automation. You can use your preferred automation tool such as PowerShell, Ansible, Bash, etc. and apply it to each project. Alternatively, if you're using a cloud provider, you can utilize their chosen automation tool if one is available. You should be able to pull down and destroy your infrastructure with whatever tools you choose, and then recreate it with automation.

### Working on these DevOps projects will teach you how to:

- read documentation and online resources
- find user communities and forums online
- troubleshoot issues
- overcome knowledge barriers
- investigate new technologies
- projects you can highlight on your CV, resume, and GitHub profile

## Projects

Majority of these tasks will take several hours to perform. If you're new to DevOps, it could take hours or even days. When you're done, you'll have some code that you can push to a Git repository and share with prospective employers! Please don't give up. Everyone must begin somewhere. Best of luck!

<summary><b>case study - deploy a single page application</b></summary><br>

**ngcruse** a fictitious company needs the help of a DevOps engineer to provision a web server with automation and publish a website onto it. In this case study, you will configure and serve a single page application (reactjs, vuejs or any spa will be fine) using Nginx and install SSL/TLS certificate to load application over HTTPS. You can use any available open source single page application for this task.

### This project helps with these job requirements:

✅ Provision and configure infrastructure through automation.

✅ Knowledge of web application development, server deployment and maintenance, and general networking practices.

✅ Experience with scripting tools such as Bash, PowerShell, Batch e.t.c

✅ Web server security.

This project will also teach you how to use the command line to interact with a Linux or Windows server.

### Steps to take:

⏺ Set up repository source code.

⏺ You can use any cloud provider to create (provision) a virtual machine.

⏺ Install Nginx on the virtual machine and configure Nginx to serve a static website.

⏺ DNS configuration

⏺ Check that you can access the website using your web browser eg (https://example.com).

### Goals of the Project:

If you don't already have a solid understanding of server administration, this will help you get one. You'll have to learn things like: what is a web server? How do you install software using a package manager?

In addition, you'll need to learn how to use an automation tool and write your first automation code.

<summary><b>case study - deploy a static sites</b></summary><br>

Imagine a startup called **risewise** build a landing page to showcase their services and they need a DevOps engineer to provision a web server with automation and publish a website onto it. In this case study, you will configure and serve a static HTML site using Nginx and install SSL/TLS certificate to load application over HTTPS.

To access the website, create a virtual server, install a web server on it, and configure networking and any necessary firewalls. You can try using web consoles to complete this task and after that use automation to provision a web server and publish a website onto it

### This project helps with these job requirements:

✅ Provision and configure infrastructure through automation.

✅ Knowledge of web application development, server deployment and maintenance, and general networking practices.

✅ Experience with scripting tools such as Bash, PowerShell, Batch e.t.c

✅ Web server security.

This project will also teach you how to use the command line to interact with a Linux or Windows server.

### Steps to take:

⏺ Set up a Git repository to save your work.

⏺ You can use any cloud provider to create (provision) a virtual machine.

⏺ Install Nginx on the virtual machine and configure Nginx to serve a static website.

⏺ Check that you can access the website using your web browser eg (https://example.com).
