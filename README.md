## Introduction

**DevOps Project Ideas** is a curated collection of DevOps project ideas based on real-world scenarios. DevOps teams may already be performing or will be required to accomplish these tasks.

Either you're transitioning into DevOps from a career as a developer or sysadmin, or you're looking to improve your DevOps skills for an entry-level position, you may be feeling exhausted by the huge amount of work ahead of you!. With basic knowledge of DevOps tools you can apply them to deploy software using this guide. These real-world projects are all focused on deploying software.

These projects cannot be completed using web consoles or point-and-click methods. You must use scripting and automation to tackle all of these issues. And besides, DevOps is built on the notion of automation. You can use your preferred automation tool such as PowerShell, Ansible, Bash, etc. and apply it to each project. Alternatively, if you're using a cloud provider, you can utilize their chosen automation tool if one is available. You should be able to pull down and destroy your infrastructure with whatever tools you choose, and then recreate it with automation.

### Working on these DevOps projects will teach you how to:

- read documentation and online resources
- find user communities and forums online
- troubleshoot issues
- overcome knowledge barriers
- investigate new technologies
- projects you can highlight on your CV, resume, and GitHub profile
